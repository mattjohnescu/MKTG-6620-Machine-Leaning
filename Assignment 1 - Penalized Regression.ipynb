    "**From what perspective are you conducting the analysis? (Who are you? / Who are you working for?):**\n",
    "I am a data analyst working for an electronics e-commerce platform aiming to understand customer purchasing behavior and predict order completion based on various customer and order attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is your question?:**\n",
    "Can we predict whether an order will be completed or canceled using customer demographics, session information, and product details?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe your dataset(s) including URL (if available).**\n",
    "The dataset is from an e-commerce company dealing in electronics, containing sales transactions, customer demographics, and order information over a one-year period. The data is synthetic, generated for analysis purposes.\n",
    "URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cameronseamons/electronic-sales-sep2023-sep2024\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is(are) your independent variable(s) and dependent variable(s)? Include variable type (binary, categorical, numeric).**\n",
    "Independent variables:\n",
    "- Gender (categorical - Male, Female, one-hot encoded)\n",
    "- Age (numeric)\n",
    "- Loyalty Member (categorical - Yes/No, one-hot encoded)\n",
    "- Product Type (categorical - one-hot encoded)\n",
    "- Rating (numeric)\n",
    "- Payment Method (categorical - one-hot encoded)\n",
    "- Total Price (numeric)\n",
    "- Quantity (numeric)\n",
    "- Shipping Type (categorical - one-hot encoded)\n",
    "- Add-ons Purchased (categorical - encoded as appropriate)\n",
    "- Add-on Total (numeric)\n",
    "Dependent variable:\n",
    "- Order Status (categorical - Completed, Cancelled, converted to binary for modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are your variables suitable for your analysis method?**\n",
    "All independent variables are either numeric or have been properly processed using one-hot encoding or binning, making them suitable for linear regression. The linear regression model can effectively work with both the scaled numeric features and the one-hot encoded categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are your conclusions (include references to one or two CLEARLY INDICATED AND IMPORTANT graphs or tables in your output)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are your assumptions and limitations? Did you include any robustness checks?**\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- The relationship between the predictors and the target is linear.\n",
    "- The data has been adequately preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Linear regression is not ideal for predicting binary outcomes, making it less suitable for this problem, as a classification model might perform better.\n",
    "- No robustness checks, such as cross-validation or residual analysis, were performed to further assess model stability and reliability.\n",
